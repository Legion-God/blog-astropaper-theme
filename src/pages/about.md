Hi, I am Shubhendra, a software developer 🧑🏻‍💻 who likes to dabble in backend tech. I love to learn about the inner workings of popular softwares and lately I'm getting curious about system design.

When I am not automating 🛠️ something that totally doesn’t need to be automated, you would find me cooking 🍽️, sleeping 😴 or sleeping 😴.

Here's my another fav quote.

> **Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.**

**_~ Richard Feynman_**

Mandatory disclosure: I use Arch, btw.
